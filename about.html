            <p>
                Hajiya Raheenah Abubakar is the founder of Home of Ni'imah Support Foundation. With a lifelong passion for helping others, she has been supporting women, children, and the less privileged through personal outreach long before officially establishing the foundation in 2023.
                Her dedication has seen her lead initiatives such as providing food relief to flood victims in Gwada, supporting widows with small-scale empowerment funds, sensitizing teenagers on personal hygiene and career goals, and distributing financial aid to women and orphans across Bosso and Chanchaga LGAs.
                She continues to seek partnerships and sponsorships, both locally and internationally, to expand the foundation's reach across Nigeria. For Hajiya Raheenah, true joy comes from uplifting lives and inspiring hope in vulnerable communities.
